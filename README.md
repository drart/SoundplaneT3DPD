Soundplane T3D Patch for Pure Data
----------------------------------

A simple port of the T3D demo patch for Soundplane using Pure Data. 

Hopefully this helps someone.


SoundPlaneMutableInstruments.pd uses the MI4PD library by Mark Harris, a port of the Mutable Instruments modules into PureData (works on Linux and OSX, possibly windows). https://github.com/TheTechnobear/Mi4Pd
